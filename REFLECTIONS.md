1. Look at the `get_file_contents()` function that has been provided for you.

   a. Look up what a `try-except` block does. What is its purpose?
   > The idea of a try-except block is to try some code that could throw a runtime error. If one occurs the except block allows the programmer to handle it.

2. Look at `the print_summary()` function that has been provided for you.

    a. Look up the dictionary method `.items()` What does it return?
    > It returns a list of tuples (a tuple is an unchangeable list) where each tuple is a key-value pair. The key is the first item in the tuple and the value is the second.

    b. Look up the function `sorted()`. What does it do and what does it return?
    > Sorted sorts a list. In this case the `key` parameter tells it to sort by the value in reverse order. It returns the sorted list.

3. For each language file, list the top five characters and their relative frequencies (percentages).

    `1.txt`
        e: 617501 (11.96%)
        t: 458879 (8.89%)
        a: 443154 (8.59%)
        o: 388026 (7.52%)
        i: 372797 (7.22%)

    `2.txt`
        e: 25151 (18.26%)
        n: 14213 (10.32%)
        a: 10391 (7.55%)
        i: 9136 (6.63%)
        o: 8401 (6.10%)

    `3.txt`
        e: 8181 (16.50%)
        n: 4912 (9.91%)
        i: 3793 (7.65%)
        t: 3705 (7.47%)
        r: 3110 (6.27%)

    `4.txt`
        e: 16830 (17.08%)
        n: 9730 (9.87%)
        r: 7690 (7.80%)
        i: 7195 (7.30%)
        s: 5911 (6.00%)

4. What are the top five characters in mystery.txt and their relative frequencies (percentages)?
    > e: 7885 (15.19%)
    > a: 5409 (10.42%)
    > n: 4155 (8.00%)
    > o: 3786 (7.29%)
    > i: 3474 (6.69%)

5. Which language file do you propose is closest to mystery.txt. Justify why in 2-3 complete sentences.
    > While it's not exact, the frequency pattern of the top five most closely matches file 2. Two turns out to be Dutch, and the mystery text is Afrikaans, which is a language that descended from Dutch.
